# Telepresence Robot Control Logic

This repository contains the core communication and vision processing logic for a Raspberry Pi-based Telepresence Robot.

## Features
- Socket-based communication for command handling
- OpenCV-based camera frame processing
- Modular movement logic prepared for GPIO motor driver integration

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Socket Programming

## Future Scope
- Integration with RPi.GPIO for real motor control
- Threading for parallel camera and command handling
- Secure communication between client and robot
